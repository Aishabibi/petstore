## 🚀 How to Run the Tests

1. **Open Postman**
2. Import the `petstore_collection.json`
3. Use base URL: `https://petstore.swagger.io/v2`
4. Run individual requests or use Collection Runner

## 📌 Notes

- No authentication is required for basic endpoints.
- Data resets periodically — test data is not persistent.
- Swagger UI was used for initial exploration and verifying endpoint behavior.
